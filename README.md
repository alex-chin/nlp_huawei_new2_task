## Description
Your task is to classify the store's review rating into 5 classes. The metric is **F1-score**.

We present you 4 baseline solutions based on logistic regression, catboost, LSTM and Transformers. You can find them in their respective folders: `./baseline_tfidf_logreg`, `./baseline_catboost`, `./baseline_rnn` and `./baseline_transformers`. Each of these folders contains a file `requirements.txt` that will help you with the installation of the dependencies. To see the score and how many points you get if you can beat him, look at the table below:

| baseline    | Accuracy    | F1-score    | Points      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| LogReg      | 0.5846      |             | `<X>` points|
| CatBoost    | 0.6455      |             | `<Y>` points|
| LSTM        | 0.6227      |             | `<Z>` points|
| Transformer | 0.6354      |             | `<V>` points|

If you will be the first in your group, you'll get 3 bonus points.

Please **DO NOT** develop your solution as a fork of this repository. Also please do not make it publicly available.

## Data

The dataset presented here was collected from one of the most popular maps. It contains reviews and ratings from 1 to 5 and we suggest you try to predict them.

- `train.csv` - The training set, comprising the `rate` and `text` of each review. `rate` comprise the target for the competition.
- `test.csv` - For the test data we give only the `text` of a review.
- `sample_submission.csv` - A submission file in the correct format.

You can download the dataset by following the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-y7bLFXH94Y5pzUHYro1iTMsqsSoaHH?usp=sharing).

## Evaluation

Submissions are scored using F1-score:

</p>

## Submission File

For each row in the test set, you need to predict one of the 5 rates, from 1 to 5. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
```
index,rate
0,5
1,5
2,5
3,5
...
```

## Usage
1. Clonning repo: `git clone https://github.com/e0xextazy/nlp_huawei_new2_task.git`
2. `cd nlp_huawei_new2_task/`
3. Create virtual environment: `python3.7 -m venv venv`
4. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Setup your baseline:
   1. TF-IDF + Logistic Regression: `./setup/setup_tf_idf_logreg.sh`
   2. Catboost: `./setup/setup_catboost.sh`
   3. LSTM: `./setup/setup_lstm.sh`
   4. Transformers: `./setup/setup_transformers.sh`
6. Download data: `./setup/download_data.sh`
7. Enjoy!
