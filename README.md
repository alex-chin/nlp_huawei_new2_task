## Description
Your task is to classify film descriptions into 6 classes. The metric is **Accuracy**.

We present you 4 baseline solutions based on logistic regression, catboost, LSTM and Transformers. You can find them in their respective folders: `./baseline_tfidf_logreg`, `./<catboost_baseline>`, `./baseline_rnn` and `./<transformer_baseline>`. Each of these folders contains a file `requirements.txt` that will help you with the installation of the dependencies. To see the score and how many points you get if you can beat him, look at the table below:

| baseline    | Accuracy    | Points      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| LogReg      | 0.43687     | `<X>` points|
| CatBoost    | 0.2324      | `<Y>` points|
| LSTM        | 0.34413     | `<Z>` points|
| Transformer | 0.6134      | `<V>` points|

If you will be the first in your group, you'll get 3 bonus points.

Please **DO NOT** develop your solution as a fork of this repository. Also please do not make it publicly available.

## Data

The dataset presented here was collected from one of the public film rating resources. We have selected the 6 most popular movie genres and invite you to try to predict them.

- `train.csv` - The training set, comprising the `movie_name`, `movie_description` and `target` of each film, the latter of which is the genre of the film. `target` comprise the target for the competition.
- `test.csv` - For the test data we give only the `movie_description` of an film together with its `movie_name`.
- `sample_submission.csv` - A submission file in the correct format.

You can download the dataset by following the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZkwB0VZ0N11HyiSqNKT5mznaHrw1wi1W?usp=sharing).

## Evaluation

Submissions are scored using Accuracy error:

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="65%" src="images/accuracy.png">
</p>

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="65%" src="images/exact_match.png">
</p>

where $N$ is the number of samples in the test dataset.

## Submission File

For each row in the test set, you need to predict one of the 6 movie genres. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
```
id,target
133530575988338041546938011932244933990,5
133530621940672299820253816187736128870,2
133530687700047186659654018829214907750,3
133531296172335296209766737246753488230,0
...
```

## Usage
1. Clonning repo: `git clone https://github.com/e0xextazy/nlp_huawei_new2_task.git`
2. `cd nlp_huawei_new2_task/`
3. Create virtual environment: `python3.7 -m venv venv`
4. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Setup your baseline:
   1. TF-IDF + Logistic Regression: `./setup/setup_tf_idf_logreg.sh`
   2. Catboost: `./setup/setup_catboost.sh`
   3. LSTM: `./setup/setup_lstm.sh`
   4. Transformers: `./setup/setup_transformers.sh`
6. Download data: `./setup/download_data.sh`
7. Enjoy!
